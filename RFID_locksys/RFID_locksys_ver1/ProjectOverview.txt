### RFID Access Control System

#### Overview:
This Arduino sketch enables the implementation of a simple RFID-based access control system using an MFRC522 RFID reader module. The system grants access to authorized individuals based on the unique identifier (UID) stored on RFID cards.

#### Components Required:
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- MFRC522 RFID Reader Module
- Relay Module
- Buzzer

#### Functionality:
1. The system waits for a RFID card to be presented to the reader.
2. Upon detecting a card, it reads its UID and compares it against a predefined list of authorized card UIDs.
3. If the UID matches an authorized card, access is granted:
   - The relay is activated to control an electronic lock.
   - Access is allowed for a specified duration (ACCESS_DELAY).
4. If the UID does not match any authorized card, access is denied:
   - A buzzer sounds as an indication of denied access.
   - Access denial duration is set by DENIED_DELAY.
5. The system loops back to wait for the next card presentation.

#### Wiring:
- MFRC522 SS_PIN to Arduino D4
- MFRC522 RST_PIN to Arduino D3
- Relay Module control pin (RELAY) to Arduino D0
- Buzzer pin to Arduino D1

#### Instructions:
1. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.
2. Make sure the wiring is correctly done.
3. Adjust the list of authorized card UIDs in the code to match your RFID cards.
4. Test the system with authorized and unauthorized RFID cards.

#### Note:
- Make sure to include the necessary libraries (SPI.h and MFRC522.h) in your Arduino IDE.
- Modify the ACCESS_DELAY and DENIED_DELAY variables according to your requirements for access duration and denial indication duration.
- This code is provided as a starting point for RFID-based access control projects and can be extended or modified based on specific project needs.
