For storing the Names with time and date create a spreadsheet in which
A1 -> Date
B1 -> Time
C1 -> Name


in 2nd spread sheet just create name or cardId in 1st column
A1 -> Name/CardID

Note: I have taken only range of A2 to A100. You can increase according to your needs just change
that part in appsScript of Card_authentication.

And provide the Sheet Id(see Youtube for further details) and Sheet Name ( like "Sheet1" which is present in lower left of google sheet)
