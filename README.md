# RFID Based Lock System with IoT Integration

## Description
This project is a simple RFID-based lock system integrated with IoT. It fetches the card IDs from a Google Sheet whenever a card is scanned and checks whether it is present in the sheet. If the card is authorized, the system validates it and opens the door solenoid lock. Additionally, it sends data to another Google Sheet where it stores the time, date, and name of the cardholder. Authorization of cards can be easily managed by providing new card IDs to the Google Sheets.

## Installation
To set up the project, you'll need the following components:
- WiFi connected microcontroller like ESP32 or ESP8266 (NodeMCU 0.9)
- RFID module
- RFID cards
- 12V solenoid lock
- Relay
- Buzzer
- 12V power supply
- 5V supply for the controller

Complete the connections following the circuit diagram provided in the repository.

## Usage
Simply complete the connections following the circuit diagram provided in the repository.
